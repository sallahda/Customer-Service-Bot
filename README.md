Twilio-GPT Chatbot
Overview
This project is a simple yet functional demonstration of integrating Twilio's voice capabilities with OpenAI's ChatGPT API to create a customer service chatbot. Built using Node.js and Express.js, it allows users to interact with a ChatGPT-powered chatbot through a phone call. The idea was to explore the potential of AI in voice-driven customer service interactions as a side project.

Features
Twilio Integration: Utilizes Twilio's Programmable Voice to set up a phone number for receiving calls.
ChatGPT Responses: Leverages the OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate conversational responses.
Voice Capability: Converts text responses from ChatGPT into speech, enabling a voice-based interaction.
Node.js Backend: A simple and efficient Node.js server using Express.js for handling API requests and responses.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed.
Twilio account and a Twilio phone number with voice capabilities.
OpenAI API key for accessing ChatGPT.
