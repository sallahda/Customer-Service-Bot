# Twilio Chatbot with GPT Integration

## Project Overview
This project is a simple demonstration of integrating Twilio's phone services with OpenAI's ChatGPT API to create an interactive voice-based customer service chatbot. It's a small side project I built to learn more about APIs, Node.js, and Express.js. The chatbot allows users to interact through voice calls, where Twilio handles the voice communication and ChatGPT provides the AI-driven responses.

## Features
- **Twilio Voice Integration**: Set up a Twilio phone number to receive calls.
- **ChatGPT Responses**: Utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate conversational responses.
- **Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Voice**: Converts user's voice input to text for processing and then converts the AI's text response back to voice.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Backend built using Node.js with Express.js framework for handling web requests.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following:
- Node.js installed (v12.x or later)
- A Twilio account with a verified phone number
- An API key from OpenAI for ChatGPT access
